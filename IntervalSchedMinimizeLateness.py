# The goal in our new optimization problem will be to schedule all requests, using nonoverlapping
# intervals, so as to minimize the maximum lateness. The lateness of a request i is defined to
# be li = f(i) âˆ’ di. Each request has a deadline di, and it requires a contiguous time interval
# of length ti, but it is willing to be scheduled at any time before the deadline.
