# A problem arises if we have many identical resources available and we wish to schedule all
# the requests using as few resources as possible. Because the goal here is to partition all
# intervals across multiple resources, we will refer to this as the Interval Partitioning Problem.
# The problem is also referred to as the Interval Coloring Problem; the terminology arises from
# thinking of the different resources as having distinct colorsâ€”all the intervals assigned to
# a particular resource are given the corresponding color
